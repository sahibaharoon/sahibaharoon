# 💫 About Me:
Hi! I’m **Sahiba Haroon**, a curious and creative student developer from India 🇮🇳 who loves blending **clean UI/UX** with **AI-powered functionality** 🤖💬. I enjoy building meaningful, visually appealing tools that are actually useful for students, like chatbots, PDF summarizers, document uploaders, hotel systems, and more!

✨ I believe even tech tools should feel warm, human, and fun — that’s why you’ll find emojis, animations, and thoughtful design across my projects 💛

---

## 🚀 I'm currently working on:
- An AI-powered **PDF Chatbot** with file uploads, typing animations, and structured emoji responses 📝🤖
- A modern **UI redesign** for student-friendly AI tools
- Full deployment with **Render**, GitHub Pages, and cloud workflows

---

## 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Anything involving **chatbots**, **frontend polish**, or **Flask + React/Streamlit**-based tools
- Projects where I can bring in visual flair ✨ or student-first thinking 🧠

---

## 🧠 I’m currently learning:
- **Model deployment & optimization**
- **LinkedIn + GitHub branding** (yes, GPRM too!)
- **Fun animations**, transitions, and file preview logic

---

## 🆘 I’m looking for help with:
- Improving **performance** on free hosts (Render etc.)
- **File size optimizations** for PDF-heavy tools
- Advanced **Git** strategies and branching

---

## ❓ Ask me about:
- Building friendly AI tools from scratch 🤝
- Streamlit, Flask, or Render deployment
- Making your chatbot say “Made with ❤️ by [You]” 😉

---

## 🎉 Fun Fact:
I once spent a whole day just trying to make a chat bubble "feel" right…  
(but hey, it was **totally worth it**) 💬✨
